# User Interface
The user interface is made in [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) which is Python's de-facto standard Graphical User Interface package. The star plots that are used in the interface are drawn in [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/), which is a toolkit library for plotting 2D data on maps in Python. 

## First Look
This is the first look that a user will get when he tries to run the user interface code. It has all the input fields, a submit button and all the choices for various views of plot that he wants to see. It also has a dark grey colored area that is the drawing area where the plots would eventually come according to the user's inputs.

## Functionality of the user plot
The user interface quite flexibility in terms of the choice of input that the user can give. You can refer to [this] page for further details on working of functionality before getting started with the user interface.
