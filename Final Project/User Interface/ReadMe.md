# User Interface
The user interface is made to ease an amateur astronomers hopping work. It provides an interface where the user can give inputs of the Messier object he wants to hop and enter the telescopic details to see how the hop will look on the sky plot. 

## First Look
This is the first look that a user will get when he tries to run the user interface code. It has all the input fields, a submit button and all the choices for various views of plot that he wants to see. It also has a dark grey colored area that is the drawing area where the plots would eventually come according to the user's inputs.

## Functionality of the user plot
The user interface gives quite a lot of flexibility in terms of the choice of input that the user can give. You can refer to [this](https://github.com/Liza23/Star-Hopping-KSP/blob/master/Final%20Project/User%20Interface/interface-functionality.md) page for further details on working of functionality before getting started with the user interface. 

## High-level Overview of Code
The entire code is written in `Python` and consists broadly of two portions, one is plotting the graphs on the interface and other is making the interface itself. The user interface is made in [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) which is Python's de-facto standard Graphical User Interface package. The star plots that are used in the interface are drawn in [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/), which is a toolkit library for plotting 2D data on maps in Python.
To understand the code working, please refer to the [coding documentation]().
