This folder contains all the database files that'll be used for plotting the stars on the star map. If you want to try hopping you can try using your own database, however this database is prepared extensively after carrying out the research properly and other detaiils can be found [here](https://github.com/SahyadriDK/Hopping).

Apart from downloading these, you're also required to download this [requirements.txt](https://github.com/SahyadriDK/Hopping/blob/master/requirements.txt) file inside the main folder where you're storing the other Python Files.
